# ArduinoMega_Game-Console
Redesigning a relatively heavy and resource intensive video game to be run on an arduino

A program to run a 2D game built from scratch
Bitmap files to be extracted onto an sd card which is then to be connected to the Arduino through an SPI bus...
The 3 matrices represent the mapping of each of the following : 
  1. Tile rendering
  2. Player Position
  3. Tile-Entity collission
  
Tile entity collision has not been implemented yet.

PS : This project is 4 years old from 2018 and has a quite a few bugs, and would probably not be restarted again...
